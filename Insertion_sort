def insertionsort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(1,n):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i-1
        while j>=0 and key<arr[j]:
            arr[j+1]=arr[j]
            j-=1
        arr[j+1] = key

arr = [4,3,2,10,12,1,5,6]
insertionsort(arr)
print(arr)

Output:-
[1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12]

NOTE:- Insertion sort is used when number of elements is small. It can also be useful when input array is almost sorted, 
        only few elements are misplaced in complete big array.

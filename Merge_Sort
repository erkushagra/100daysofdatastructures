Note:-  [Time complexity of Merge Sort is O(nLogn) in all 3 cases (worst, average and best)
------  as merge sort always divides the array into two halves and take linear time to merge 
        two halves.]
       
       Applications of Merge Sort :-
       ----------------------------
               
       => Merge Sort is useful for sorting linked lists in O(nLogn) time.In the case of linked lists, the case is different mainly due to the difference 
       in memory allocation of arrays and linked lists. Unlike arrays, linked list nodes may not be adjacent in memory. Unlike an array, in the linked list,
       we can insert items in the middle in O(1) extra space and O(1) time. Therefore merge operation of merge sort can be implemented without extra space for linked lists.
       
       In arrays, we can do random access as elements are contiguous in memory. Let us say we have an integer (4-byte) array A and let the address of A[0] be x then to access
       A[i], we can directly access the memory at (x + i*4). Unlike arrays, we can not do random access in the linked list. Quick Sort requires a lot of this kind of access. 
       In linked list to access i’th index, we have to travel each and every node from the head to i’th node as we don’t have a continuous block of memory. 
       Therefore, the overhead increases for quicksort. Merge sort accesses data sequentially and the need of random access is low.
